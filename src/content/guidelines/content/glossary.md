## Consistency in language

This section covers the approved **action labels** and **idioms** for use in the IBM products and documentation. Users rely on consistent labels for common actions to predict how to interact with an interface. Idioms are expressions that have a meaning different from the meaning of each word in the expression.

This section is a living document. When new terms are introduced, they will be added here.
